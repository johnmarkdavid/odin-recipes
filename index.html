    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Home cooks are our heroesâ€”it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.</p>
    
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Allrecipes changed the food world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips, while celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then, Allrecipes has become the world's largest community-driven food brand, providing trusted resources to more than 60 million home cooks each month.</p>
